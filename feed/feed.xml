    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently learned that my job is being outsourced. The favorite part of my current job is when I get to write PowerShell to solve problems so with that in mind, Iâ€™m going see this opportunity to teach myself web development with the intent of becoming a web developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already understand lots of development concepts because of my experience with PowerShell. I use and understand VS Code, git, patterns and practices etc. I have lots to learn when it comes to working with a team of other developers, who are all working on the same things though; I look forward to the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every article Iâ€™ve read as part of my research says to learn HTML/CSS, vanilla JavaScript then pick a framework. Iâ€™m undecided on the framework just yet but if my Twitter TL is any indication, React is super popular with Angular, TypeScript and Vue also getting lots of mentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m currently working my way through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/&quot;&gt;freeCodeCamp.org&lt;/a&gt; Responsive Web Design Certification. Iâ€™ll also be working through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development&quot;&gt;Codecademy Web Development&lt;/a&gt; paid course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learn by doing so getting stuff to show up on the page is super rewarding. I usually learn best when I just hack around and google to figure things out. Then I like to go back and read about the things Iâ€™m just copying and pasting and reading closer on the topics I donâ€™t fully understand by experimenting. Because of that, I expect this site to go through many iterations as Iâ€™m learning new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m currently on the HTML/CSS phase as I really want to make sure Iâ€™m really and truly understanding the concepts at this phase. Semantic HTML, Accessible HTML and CSS Flexbox, site design and color theory as it relates to site design, Figma. I want to be able to design and build a site and make it look nice without having to just steal other peopleâ€™s designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck. ðŸ˜Ž&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2020-09-06T19:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://mharley.dev/thoughts/lessons-learned-from-bridgestone/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After nearly 5 years with Bridgestone, Iâ€™ll be leaving the company because of restructuring. Since the announcement, Iâ€™ve reflected about my lessons learned that I can take away with me and onto my next opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Savings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isnâ€™t really a career thing, but itâ€™s the first thing that came into my mind when I received the news. My savings isnâ€™t great, and I wish Iâ€™d done better with my savings leading up to this. I barely have three months of living expenses saved up, but having closer to six sure would make me feel a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 1: Take savings goals seriously, and having more makes me feel better. My goal is to have 6 months of living expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I donâ€™t know if this is a company culture thing or just business in general once a company gets to a certain size or youâ€™re at a certain level in your career, but relationships are super important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is a mistake to be the geek in the hoody, preferring the company of servers and code to talking to business teammates. Even if my immediate peers and manager understood how important the work I was doing was and that Iâ€™m good at my job and a good teammate, thatâ€™s not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I donâ€™t want to be a fake, glad handing type, but I think thereâ€™s a way to be mindful of relationships thatâ€™s genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 2: Be genuine and mindful about relationships at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Professional Relationships outside of work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do I want to be mindful of my work relationships, I want to be mindful about maintaining professional relationships. Colleagues from previous jobs and people met at conferences or meetups can be a pretty valuable source of job leads when itâ€™s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I donâ€™t want to be cheesy and fake about these relationships, but I just want to be intentional and genuine. Networking and being part of the developer community just makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 3: Maintain professional relationships outside of work by being intentional and genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resume&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I updated, looked at, or thought about my resume was when I was applying for my job current jobâ€”nearly five years ago. I want to be intentional about reviewing my resume regularly. Iâ€™m envisioning just keeping a little note of accomplishments that Iâ€™m proud of. Maybe I review this note at the end of each week? This will take 5 minutes or less, once a week. Then maybe thereâ€™s a quarterly touch point where Iâ€™m reviewing my resume and making sure my best accomplishments are listed? In short, I want to keep my resume current and up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 4: Keep my resume current regardless of my current employment status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see lots of people complaining about the LinkedIn recruiter emails, but I think a different approach is better for me. Even if Iâ€™m not looking for any opportunities, I plan to respond to the recruiter emails and connect with them. I want to build my network organically, so if Iâ€™m faced with another unexpected layoff, making connections doesnâ€™t seem desperate or self-serving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think connecting with your immediate manager and peers is a great idea too. I want to do this when start at new places instead of when Iâ€™m about to leave!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 5: Build and nurture my professional network with LinkedIn including recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Github&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve been writing PowerShell to solve problems for nearly eight years now. Iâ€™ve written functions and snippets for work that Iâ€™m proud of, but my workflow has never included using github to store the code. I want to develop a github profile thatâ€™s a good reflection of my work. I think having a long history of github work looks really good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 6: Adjust development workflow to include github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I think it boils down to having a mindset that assumes Iâ€™m about to be laid off. Again, not that I want to be paranoid about it, but I think itâ€™s just good disaster preparedness and mindfulness. Iâ€™ll be implementing these takeaways as I seek my next opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take savings goals seriouslyâ€”the more, the better. Have six months of living expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 2: Be genuine and mindful about relationships at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 3: Maintain professional relationships outside of work by being intentional and genuine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 4: Keep my resume current regardless of my current employment status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 5: Build and nurture my professional network with LinkedIn including recruiters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson 6: Adjust development workflow to include github.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
